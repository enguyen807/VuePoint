# vuepoint

Hey if you've found this project I'm pretty much just trying to make a full CMS using VueJS, and Node from the ground up. 
This project will let users create and manage their posts, while also be able to send their own customized newsletters out to subscribers.
In addition, admins can target different groups of user's depending on what categories they've chosen to follow.

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
